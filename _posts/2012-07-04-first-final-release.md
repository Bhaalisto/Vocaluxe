#### Dear Vocaluxe fans,  

just in time for the holidays we've compiled our first final release after roughly one year of development time - Vocaluxe 0.1 final is ready to be unleashed!
<!--more-->
So don't think twice and download it from Sourceforge. How about a round (or two?) of Vocaluxe between the egg hunt and the lamb roast?

You don't want to wait for the next final release and want to follow the latest edge of development instead? Just follow the developers on the Github Vocaluxe repository!
